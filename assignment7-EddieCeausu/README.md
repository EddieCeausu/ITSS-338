# Assignment 7 - Drill Down List

As most applications have some sort of navigation, this assignment will allow you to get some hands-on experience with navigation. 

## Requirements

1. Create an application that uses a drill-down list navigation approach from a main list view.
2. When an item is tapped within the list view, navigate to the new page to display information about the item tapped. Feel free to show as much data as you'd like about the details, but at a minimum, show the item title that was clicked.
3. On the detail page, add a button that when clicked, returns the user back to the original page.

## Tips

Feel free to use what you created last week as a base for this assignment.  It may make it easier if you have an item and it's price to show on the details page.  Some other things that would make sense to display may include an additional description or ingredients, etc.

Have fun!
