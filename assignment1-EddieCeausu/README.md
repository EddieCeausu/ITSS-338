# Assignment 1 - Visual Studio Setup and Debugging

The purpose of this assignment is to make sure you get Visual Studio installed and configured correctly as we begin the course. No strenuous coding will be required this week, but you will have to submit work showing that you were able to create an appropriate solution and tweak a small thing.

You may follow along with the demo video for this week for getting this going, but here are some other steps to keep in mind as a general guideline.

1. Launch Visual Studio
2. Click clone a repository
3. Enter the url for your GitHub assignment to clone after you've clicked the link in iLearn to generate the assignment repository
4. Clone to a local path on your machine.  For Windows, I would recommend putting all of your files under a short directory like this: c:\code\itss338\assignment1
5. Make sure that all projects load. Note that if you are using Visual Studio for Mac, the UWP project project will not load and be expected
6. Click on Build from main menu and make sure you can build the solution
    - Assignment1 project is your Xamarin.Forms project
    - Assignment1.Android is the Android project
    - Assignment1.iOS is the iOS project.  Note that you will have to pair to a mac if you want to try to debug iOS. I don't cover this in the course, but if this is something that interests, you, go for it.
    - Assignment1.UWP is the windows based project
7. Right click the UWP project, choose Debug, Start New Instance
8. You should have a fully functional Xamarin app running!
9. Expand the Assignment1 project and find the MainPage.xaml
10. Replace "Start developing now" with "Hello World, my name is {your name here}"
11. Go to the Team Explorer and see the Changes section
    - You can also get to this by the pencil icon on the bottom task bar.
12. Enter a description for the changes you made and use the Commit All and Sync option to save and push the changes to GitHub
    - You can commit and push separately if you'd rather
13. You should be able to browse back out to the original GitHub assignment link and see that your changes were pushed.
    - You don't have to submit anything to iLearn to let me know that you submitted the assignment unless you want to for tracking.  I'll be looking in GitHub to grade assignments, so you don't need to upload any code separately to iLearn.

If you run into any issues or errors, please first email me to let me know what the problem is as well as any relevant error messages you see or screenshots that you think may be helpful.

Good luck on your first assignment
