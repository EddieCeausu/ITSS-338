# Assignment 2 - Simple Button

In this assignment, you'll create a simple mobile app that allows the user to click a button to perform an action. I'm leaving what action happens when the button is clicked up to you, but I'll list a couple of options below.

## Requirements

1. At the top of your application, have a header with a fictional company or app name.
2. Display a button used to trigger an action. Make sure the button text corresponds to the action it triggers. Ideas that you can use for the action include items as follows:
    - Display a random number (like rolling a die here potentially)
    - Display the current time
    - Display a random quote (potentially using an array of strings to pull a random quote)
    - Any number of other ideas can work here as well, just make sure it's not what was covered in the demo. For example, don't always set it to a fixed string and don't do the simple counter increasing every time the button is clicked
3. Have a label at the bottom that is updated when the button is clicked.

If you have any questions about the assignment requirements, feel free to reach out.
