# Assignment 3 - Grid Layout

In this assignment, use a Grid as part of your layout.

## Requirements

1. Use a Grid layout within your app. It doesn't have to be the only layout in your app, but you must have a Grid to display part of the app.
2. Have at least 3 rows and 3 columns.
3. Provide some sort of use interaction within your application.  I'll leave it up to you to decide what you want your app to do, but I've provided some options here that you may find interesting or spark another idea:
    - Tic-Tac-Toe - track the current user and using buttons in each grid cell, change the button to an X or O when the user clicks, alternating X/O between clicks.
    - Point of Sale application - for this idea, you can have a button in the different grid cells with the name of something a customer may by, i.e. burger, fries, pizza, soda, and etc.  For each item clicked, increase a label on the screen showing the total amount.
    - Memory Match game - clicking items in the different grid cells flip over an image (or text if you want to keep it simpler) as a classic memory match game so that when you find 2 matching items, they stay revealed. Note that for this, you'll want an even number of cells, so you'd want to target at least 4x4.
    - Funny Name Generator - use the first column to have a list of first names, second for middle names, and third for last names.  When the users clicks a button for each column, generate a name using the pieces they selected (if a first name is clicked and the user clicks another first name, replace the generated first name).
    - Other options can work for this too if you have a similar idea that's interactive. If you have another idea but aren't sure if it would work, email me and I'll let you know.
